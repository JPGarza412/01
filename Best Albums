<p> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1Sur33x6g7tvdd9GQnHhhu?si=hu7cWIuRSi6LepNtV2YxhA"> The Royal Scam </a>, an album by Steely Dan, was made in 1976. The album was the second album to be written since they lost their lead 
guitarist Jeff Baxter, yet has some of their most prominent guitar work. It references many notable events and has some of the most 
musically unique and complex melodic compositions as compared to many albums before that. It made it to #15 on the charts upon its
release and is very underappreciated for its mastery of melodies, and meaningful lyrics alike.

<h2> Out of the Blue & Concerto for a Rainy Day </h2>

<p2> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/3usnShwygMXVZB4IV5dwnU?si=IbnuFH0uQLqGdrv7rPX5bw"> Out of the Blue</a> is ELO's most known album and rightfully so. Jeff Lynne originally had Out of the Blue and his famed Concerto for a 
Rainy day seperate, but he has since merged them into a massive and amazing 17 song album. Jeff Lynne wrote his concerto based off of
the weather and each song bring to the table a new mood and composition depending on the weather. Overall his masterpiece should be known
by everyone, and should live forever as possibly the greatest album of all time. </p2>

<h3> Aerial Ballet </h3> 
<img src=AerialBallet.JPEG alt=ablum cover style="float:left;width:250px;height:250px;">
<p3> Harry Nilsson... a name not well known, and for no good reason. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0H3v4snD6xhworsjXndsai?si=sI54QADxSyWLP1UL9USOYg">Harry Nillson's 1968 album</a> is a slow and graceful album which combines 
western and eastern musical and lyrical styles into one. Harry's styles are reminiscent to his birthplace in Brooklyn, New York and can
be compared to Billy Joel's New York style. But not only does he use the New York style, but utilizes western folk and western type tunes. 
Its is clear that Nilsson takes influence from the Beatles and even uses the string quintet which George Martin utilizes in the many of 
the Beatles songs. Nilssons album is composed like a musical or ballet soundtrack which was obviously done on purpose.  John Lennon even
expresses his content with Nilssons genius by saying Nilsson is his favorite american artist, which from the Beatle himself means a lot.    </p3>
